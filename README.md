## Introduction

### The Need to simplify our access to Data

_Data driven decision making (DDDM)_ has become one of the fundamental concepts of modern businesses. A modern business leverages all its available data in order to take informed decisions. But leveraging all available data is in general difficult and cumbersome as
the data sources are often decentralized, heterogeneous and chaotic. In order to facilitate the
access to four different data sources (SalesForce, IQVIA, Redbook & Lauer) [_4c-Visual_][1] has been created. [_4c-Visual_][1] is a combination of a Python script ([4c-update][2]) and the Business Intelligence Tool [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/de-de/) (by Microsoft).
